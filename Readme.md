# Hands on tech lab

Welcome to the *86 400* tech lab! This repository represents a small piece of the *86 400* code base. The intent of this lab is to provide an opportunity to get an insight into one's coding style, ability and thought process - also as an opportunity to learn from each other!

## About

A simple express project with two endpoints, each requiring a different style of Authorization.

# Getting started

* Run `npm install`
* Run `npm run test`
* Check tests that are failing and trouble shoot what needs to be fixed in the application code
